          <p class="lead">Children at this point in development have a solid grasp on the basics of counting
            and are developing a more advanced understanding that allows them to see the 
            patterns involved in the counting process. Children can consistently count up to 20
            and may be discovering the repeating pattern withing each decade (e.g., 20, 30, 40),
            allowing them quickly learn how to count up to 100. Below are different activities we have compiled with the help of early childcare experts. These activities
            and suggestions are meant to be a starting point or framework for you and your child to explore. Adapt or change the activities to find out what works 
            best for you and your child. The best activities are those that you and your child enjoy doing and want to do again!</p>
            <p class="lead">To help guide your understanding of your child's mathematical skills based off your answers on the previous page, we have also included
                an overview of your child's progress towards the bottom of this page.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Cardinality</h2>
        <p class="lead">Children’s understanding of counting and cardinality (the total number of items in a set)
          initially develop separately. Early on, children’s understanding of counting develops much 
          like their understanding of the ABC's – they know the order the words go in but they do not 
          yet know the set size that each number word goes to. At this point in development children 
          have started to make this connection and should be able to tell you how many there are after counting. For example,
           being asked to count a set of eight toy cars and telling you there are eight. 
           However, children may still struggle with consistently answering how many there are when it involves larger sets or 
           when it involves having to count out only a subset of items (e.g., can you count out all the yellow M&Ms and tell me how many there are?).
           Such counting requires coordination children are not used to needing, making it more difficult for them to follow along and keep track of how many there are.
           There are several ways to help children understand how to coordinate counting to identify larger sets, including using counting books and 
           incorporating cardinality questions into everyday activities!</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Story Problems</h2>
        <p class="lead">Once children have developed an understanding of counting and set size (cardinality),
          they can begin to understand how to combine and decompose sets. 
           At this point in development children will rely less on needing use physical objects to keep track of what is being asked. 
           Instead they can begin to mentally represent the numbers being discussed (e.g., knowing that if there are three kids playing and two more 
           were to join, then there would be five kids in all). Being able to keep track of such questions and story problems shows a more advanced understanding
          of mathematics that sets children up well for their time in school.</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Number Naming</h2>
        <p class="lead">At this point in development, children may show a bigger interest in numbers, wanting to show off all the numerals they know! This understanding
          of how their number words connect to the numerals they provides children with a symbolic understanding of mathematics. Although children may know many different numerals, they will still 
          struggle to name numbers they are unfamiliar with and will still need help linking these numerals to their relative set. For example, once children can identify 10 and 8, they may still need help 
          to understand that 10 is more than 8.
          To help strengthen
          children's understanding of these mathematical symbols, regular exposure and use of numerals is necessary as well as regular comparison of different numerals. Fortunately,
          there are many fun activities, such as board and card games that allow children to show off their number naming and comparison skills!</p>
