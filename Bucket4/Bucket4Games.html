    <p>
        Games provide a fun way to engage with numbers! 
        Games that require children to identify how many items there are can be a 
        great way to engage their counting skills, giving them the ability to connect their counting with the total number (cardinality). Card and board games with numerals 
        can add another layer of learning.
    </p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center">What to keep in mind when choosing and playing games:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Integrate Counting Into Gameplay:
            Make the most of the counting opportunities that the game naturally provides. 
            For example, when moving game pieces, count the spaces out loud with your child. 
            Also, count the game pieces, cards, or other elements before and after the game. 
            This consistent, casual reinforcement of counting will help your child develop this skill.</li>
        <li>Highlight Numerals: If playing card games or board games that include the numeral, draw your child's attention to the number.
            Provide encouragement when they attend to the numerals even if they make a mistake. Pretend you don't know what the name for a number
            may be and ask your child for help. 
        </li>    
        <li>Model Counting:
            Demonstrate how to count correctly during your turn. 
            Count your pieces, count out loud when you move your marker, and so on. 
            This modeling will give your child a clear example to imitate.
            </li>    
        <li>
            Keep it Fun:
            The primary goal should always be enjoyment. Make sure to keep the game fun and exciting for your child. 
            If they're enjoying the game, they're more likely to engage with the math. 
            Don't press too hard on the educational aspect; let learning happen naturally through play. Lastly, be sure 
            to mix in both easy and challenging questions for your child. They're more likely to stay engaged and have fun when 
            they feel like they know what to do. 
        </li>

    <h1 style="text-align:center"> Examples of Easy Games to Play at Home:</h1>
    <div class="game-div">
        <h2>Number Scavenger Hunt</h2>
        <p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong>Post-it notes or small pieces of paper, a marker, a large piece of paper or poster board to create a number line.</p>
        <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prepare the Number Line: Draw a large number line from 1 to 20 on a piece of paper or poster board. 
                This will serve as the home base for your number hunt. 
                Make sure to write the numbers clearly and large enough for your child to see.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Number Notes: Write the numbers 1 to 20 on the post-it notes or small pieces of paper. 
                Depending on your child's abilities, you can invite them to help with this step. 
                This gives them a chance to practice writing and recognizing numerals.</li>
            <li>Hide the Numbers: Hide these notes around your house. 
                You can make some easy to find and others more challenging, depending on your child's age and how much time you want to spend on the game.</li> 
            <li>Start the Hunt: Now, your child can start hunting for the numbers. As they find each number, have them say it out loud and then bring it back to the number line.</li>
            <li>Match the Numbers: Your child's task is to match the number on the note they found to the same number on the number line. 
                Encourage them to say the number out loud again as they stick it on the line.</li> 
            <li>Continue the Game: The game continues until all the numbers have been found and correctly placed on the number line.</li>          
        </ul>
        <p>The "Number Hunt" game gives your child lots of practice recognizing numerals and understanding their order. 
            Plus, it gets them moving and adds an element of excitement to learning numbers. 
            Be sure to provide guidance and support if your child struggles with any numbers, and remember, the aim is to have fun!
             Happy hunting!</p>

        <h2>Number Line Leapfrog</h2>
        <p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong>A number line going up to 30, 40, 50, or whatever number you choose. You could draw this on a piece of paper or on the sidewalk with chalk.</p>
        <p><strong>How to play:</strong>Start at 1 on the number line. The goal is to leap or step along the line, but instead of going in order, challenge your child to skip-count. 
            For example, they could jump to every 5th number (5, 10, 15, etc.) or every 10th number (10, 20, 30, etc.). 
            This introduces the concept of skip counting, which is an important foundation for later arithmetic.</p>
        <p>A basic activity for teaching counting and cardinality is a game based on the principle of one-to-one correspondence. 
            You can use objects like blocks, buttons, or fruit. Scatter a small number of these items on a table, and ask the child to count them. 
            As they say each number, encourage them to touch or move each item. 
            This helps them understand that each count corresponds to one item, reinforcing the concept of cardinality.</p>

    <div class="game-div">
        <h2>Race to 100</h2>
        <p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong>Two dice, two tokens or markers, and a number chart or line going up to 100.</p>
        <p><strong>How to play:</strong>Players take turns rolling the dice, adding the numbers that come up, and moving their token that number of spaces on the number chart or line.
            The first player to reach or pass 100 is the winner. 
            This game reinforces addition and counting up to 100.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="game-div">
        <h2>Card Counters!</h2>
        <p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong>A deck of cards (with the face cards removed for simplicity)</p>
        <p><strong>How to play:</strong>Divide the deck equally between you and your child. 
            Each of you turns over a card at the same time and adds the two numbers together. 
            Whoever says the correct sum first, wins the round and gets to keep the cards. 
            The game continues until all cards have been played. The player with the most cards at the end wins. 
            This game can easily be adapted for subtraction or multiplication, too.</p>

    <h3><strong>Other helpful activities</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Set a specific number of items (e.g., three books to read at bedtime, 
            two cookies for dessert) and help your child work to get them by asking questions
             (e.g., “You have five books. How many do we need to put back?” 
             “You have one cookie. How many more can you have?”)</li>
        <li>Ask your child if he/she has a certain number of something. 
            Ask how he/she knows. Don’t always use the correct number. 
            (e.g., “Do you have three eyes?” “Do you have two feet?”)</li>
        <li>Count out food during snack time. Say how many there will be and then count until the total. </li>    
        <li>Estimate how many items are in a group and then count to check.</li>    
        <li>Play board games and count out the total number of moves. 
            For example, if moving four spaces, say “Four! 1-2-3-4! I moved four spaces.” </li>

    </ul>
