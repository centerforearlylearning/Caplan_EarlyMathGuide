    <h1 style="text-align:center"><strong><em>Activities for Consistent Counters</em></strong></h1>
    <p>There are many different ways to incorporate mathematics into everyday activities!</p>
    <hr>
    <h3><strong>Physical Activities</strong></h3>
    <p>A fun way to have children count forwards and backwards.</p>
    <p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong> A long space to jump, and a way hundred chart (or a paper that you can draw a grid on).</p>
    <p><strong>Activity:</strong>Start at one end of the room and have your child jump as they count all the way up to 100.
        To help visualize, you could draw a hundred chart on a large piece of paper or even on your driveway with chalk. 
        This is a fun, active way to learn counting.</p>
    <p><strong>Bonus option:</strong>Have your child jump backwards and have to count backwards. For smaller numbers, you can ask them to jump multiple times backwards 
    to have them practice arithmetic (e.g., at eight jumps ask "You're at eight. If we jump back two spots, where will you be then?"</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Fruit Salad Math</h3>
    <p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong>A variety of fruit of your choice, and a bowl.</p>
    <p><strong>Activity:</strong>Together with your child, count the number of each type of fruit you have. 
        Then create simple math problems. 
        For example, if you have 5 apples and 3 oranges, you can ask, "How many pieces of fruit do we have in total?" 
        Once you've worked through a few of these problems, you can cut the fruit up (adults only) and enjoy the fruit salad you've made together!</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Pizza Parlor</h3>
    <p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong>Paper, markers, play dough.</p>
    <p><strong>Activity:</strong>Create a pretend pizza parlor. Your child can draw pizzas and cut them out, or make them from play dough. 
        Make a menu with different toppings that cost different amounts. 
        Then, play restaurant: when you "order" a pizza with certain toppings, your child must add up the total cost. 
        Or, give your child a budget and see if they can subtract the cost of each topping from their total to stay under budget.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3><strong>Gardening</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Materials needed:</strong>Seeds, pot or clear plastic cup filled with soil, a small shovel or spoon, small sticks or popsicle sticks, a marker.</p>
        <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Count the Seeds: Have your child count out the seeds, encouraging them to count out loud as they pick up each seed. It can be 
                particularly helpful to pick a number beyond twelve to help your child practice counting into the teens.
            </li>
            <li>Prepare the Labels: This is where we'll introduce numerals. 
                For each seed, your child will make a label with a number on it. 
                Give them a stick and a marker and ask them to help you write the numbers 1 through the total number of seeds on them. 
                This gives them practice recognizing and writing numerals.</li>
            <li>Dig the Holes: Have your child make small holes in the soil for the seeds. Encourage them to count aloud each hole as they dig it.</li>
            <li>Plant the Seeds and Match the Labels: Now, as your child plants each seed, have them match the label with the same number to the seed. For example, the first seed they plant gets the label "1", the second seed gets the label "2", and so on. 
                This helps reinforce the link between the numeral, the spoken number, and the quantity.</li>
            <li>Cover and Water: Your child can now cover the seeds with soil and water them. Encourage them to count as before and keep track of how many they've watered.</li>
            <li>Monitor Growth: As the seeds sprout and grow, continue to refer to the plants by their numeral. This keeps reinforcing the numerals over time. You can ask questions like, "How is plant number 15 doing today?" or "Can you water plants 10 to 20?"</li>
        </ul>

    <h3><strong>Baking and Cooking</strong></h3>
        <p>Baking and cooking can provide a fun and delicious way to learn math! Here is one example of how to incorporate math into baking cookies.</p>
        <p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong>Your favorite cookie dough recipe ingredients, cookie cutters, baking sheets, and a marker and paper for labeling.</p>
        <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Count the Ingredients: As you gather your ingredients, have your child help count each item. 
                For example, "We need 2 eggs" or "We need 3 cups of flour." 
                This helps your child practice counting and associating numbers with quantities. Be sure to both count and then identify how many items there are in all.</li>
            <li>Measure and Mix: Involve your child in the measuring and mixing process. 
                For instance, they can help measure the flour, count the number of spoonfuls of sugar, or the number of times they stir the batter. 
                Reinforce the quantity of each ingredient and the steps in the process by counting aloud together.</li>
            <li>Shape the Cookies: Roll out the dough and let your child cut out shapes using cookie cutters. Have them count each cookie they cut out, and challenge them to cut out a specific number of cookies, such as "Can you cut out 15 cookies?"</li>
            <li>Label the Cookies: Prepare small paper labels for each cookie with numbers 1 to 20 written on them (or however many cookies you're making). Place or tape these labels next to each cookie on the baking sheet. This helps reinforce number recognition.</li>
            <li>Bake and Enjoy: Once the cookies are ready and have cooled down, ask your child to serve a specific number of cookies based on the labels. For example, "Can you please give me cookie number 6 and cookie number 18?"</li>
        </ul>
