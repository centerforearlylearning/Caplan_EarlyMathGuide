    <p>Visual media can provide a great way to help children learn mathematics. Videos provide a fun context and can 
        introduce friendly and memorable characters to help children feel comfortable with mathematics. It is important to keep 
        in mind that children learn from screen time to whatever extent they are able to be engaged with the material. When parents 
        watch along with their child and ask them questions or help them when they get stuck children learn the most. It is best to think 
        of educational screen time much like you would think of shared storybook reading. Both you and your child should be engage with the material 
        and you can help keep their attention on the mathematics by asking questions.</p>

    <h3>Educational videos</h3>
    <p>There are many different websites that offer fun and engaging activities and lessons to help your child learn math. Be sure to 
        pause the videos and ask questions throughout. Have your child explain how adding and taking away changes the number of items. Here are a few high-quality educational resource:</p>
    <p><strong><a href=https://www.pbs.org/video/solve-word-problems-using-a-checklist-engage-in-a-number-ta-2egxto/>PBS Kids.</a> </strong>There are many videos and games available on the PBS Kids website. Here is an example of a video that helps with number comparison.</p>
    <p><strong><a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnBeGmjWnK4>Sesame Street.</a> </strong>Sesame Street offers many different videos and songs to help children learn mathematics. Research has shown Sesame Street to be a great resource to promote children's educational skills.</p>
    <p><strong><a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzry4El55bc></a>Khan Academy Kids.</a> </strong>Khan Academy has many different resources available online and through its free app. Here is an example of a virtual circle time that includes some simple addition and counting questions.</p>
    

    <h3>Read-alongs</h3>
    <p>There are many different resources available for finding new and exciting storybooks that teach different aspects of mathematics. Here are two different 
        groups that have put together mathematics books you can follow along with! Be sure to pause and ask your own questions while you follow along!</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://kidtimestorytime.com/playlists/123s-counting/">KidTime StoryTime.</a> </strong> This website provides a wide variety of children's book read-alongs that you and your child can choose from.</p>
    <p><strong><a href=https://www.youtube.com/@scienceandstoriescollabora1136>Science and Stories Collaborative.</a> </strong>These books provide fun stories to help your child learn about patterns.</p>

    <h3><strong>Storybook Alternatives</strong></h3>
    <p>If you would prefer to focus on storybooks, there are several ways to incoporate math during book reading too!</p>
    <p><strong>What to look for: </strong>Although there are many number and math books available, 
        almost any picture book can become a great resource for early math learning! 
        The best books are books that you and your child enjoy reading together. Research has shown time and again that 
        children learn the most when their caregivers ask questions as they read the book. By incorporating questions about math 
        (e.g., "Who has the most apples?" or "Can you count the mice and tell me how many there are?"), you are helping your child learn foundational skills.</p>
    <p><strong>What to avoid:</strong>What to avoid: Lift-the-flap books can provide interactivity and surprises for book reading, 
        but when trying to find a book for teaching specific concepts, these books can be distracting and make it harder for children to learn. 
        Similarly, avoid books that draw attention away from mathematics or towards non-numerical features. </p>
    <p><strong>What to do on each page:</strong> After reading each page try to think of a question that compares quantities, asks your child to count,
    or requires them to predict what comes next.</p>

    <h3>Storybook Examples</h3>
    <p>The best books to read with your child are those that the both of you enjoy and want to read again! Whichever book you choose, you can easily adapt it focus on counting, number naming, or identifying how many items there are on a page. </p>
