    <h1><strong><em>Developmental Milestone</em></strong></h1>
    <p>Once children have developed an understanding of counting and set size (cardinality),
         they can begin to understand how to combine and decompose sets.
          Initially, children will be able to show an understanding of simple arithmetic using 
          manipulatives such as blocks. For example, understanding that adding one item and then 
          removing one item leaves the total number the same. Eventually, children link this 
          understanding to their understanding of mathematical symbols. 
          The symbolic understanding of mathematics that comes from knowing how to count and 
          recognizing numerals allows children to perform the more advanced arithmetic they 
          will learn at school.</p>

    <h3><strong>Activities</strong></h3>
    <p>Goal: Children still working on mastering their counting skills can also be encouraged
        to ask more advanced questions to develop simple sums knowledge. 
        Asking children to engage in more instances of mathematical thinking
        can help strengthen their understanding of how to use mathematics in the real world.  </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Count blocks or LEGOs as you stack them. Compare stacks of different sizes 
            (e.g., which is taller and why).</li>
        <li>Work together to make things fair and even (e.g., if you are having hot chocolate, 
            encourage your child to count the same number of marshmallows into each cup).</li>    
    </ul>

    <h3>Storybook Reading</h3>
    <p>Goal: While reading storybooks, you can ask children math questions to get 
        them thinking more about math.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://familymath.stanford.edu/activities/reading-together/?lang=english&role=preschoolers">Easy-to-use guides for incoporating mathematics into different children's books.</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.mathsthroughstories.org/addition--subtraction.html">Find books recomended for children's early addition skills.</a> These books may be difficult for children to complete, but gaining experience reading with you can help strengthen their understanding of, and familiarity with, story problems.</li>
            <li><a href="https://kidtimestorytime.com/playlists/123s-counting/">Watch read-alouds with your child!</a> Be sure to pause and ask questions to help them follow along.</li>
        </ul>
