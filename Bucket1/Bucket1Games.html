    <h1 style="text-align:center"><strong><em>Games for Beginning Counters</em></strong></h1>
    <p>
        Games provide a fun way to engage with numbers! 
        Games that require children to identify how many items there are can be a 
        great way to engage their counting skills. Look for games where children can 
        guess or estimate the total and then check the answer through counting. 
        Here, it is important to both identify the total and use counting, 
        so that children can develop an understanding of how counting is used to determine how many there are. 
        For board games, look for ones that allow children to move along the board in a relatively straight
         line (e.g., chutes and ladders). To help children develop an understanding of how to count from 
         1-to-10, have children count out the number of spots they move and have them watch while you do
          the same. For card games, look for cards that have a countable set (e.g., playing cards) 
          and ask children to count the smaller numbers to find out how many there are.

    <h1>Go Fish!</h1>
    <p>Using a deck of cards, remove the face cards (Jack, Queen, and King). Each player draws five cards. The goal of the game is to match your number to one of your opponents. Players take turns asking another player if they have a specific number (e.g., “mom, do you have a four?”). If the player does have that card they give it the requester and the requester sets those cards aside. To check that the numbers match, count the items on each card to show the total numbers are the same! If the player does not have that card, they say “Nope. Go fish!” and the requester draws another card from the pile. The game continues until the pile is gone and the players have matched all cards. At the end, the player with the most pairs wins. This helps children make the connection between counting and the total number and also understand numerical equality.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="game-div">
    <h1>Memory</h1>
    <p>Using a deck of cards, remove the face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) and pick out two of the suits of cards. This will leave you with 9 cards for each suit, and the goal will be to find the two cards where the number matches. Place the cards face down in front of you and your child. Each player is allowed to flip two cards at a time to check how many there are. If the cards do not match, place both cards face down once again. If they do match, the player gets to keep those cards. At the end of the game, the player with the most cards wins! To help your child understand the total on each card, be sure to count out the items on each card. This can also be helpful for children learning to recognize numerals.  </p>

    <div class="game-div">
    <h1>Number War</h1>
    <p>Using a deck of cards, remove the face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) and divide the pile evenly between players. Each player then draws from the top of their pile. The player who has more on the card that they draw wins the hand and collects the cards. To check how many there are on each card be sure to count! If the two numbers match, each player then draws three more cards face down. Then, the fourth card that is drawn from each pile is used to break the tie – the player with the card with “more” wins the hand and all the cards. This continues until one player no longer has any cards remaining. The player with the most cards wins. By counting to compare how many are on each card, children are learning both how counting can be used to identify a total as well as how to compare relative values of different numbers. </p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center"> Other Easy Games to Play at Home:</h1>
    <div class="game-div">
        <h2>One-to-One Correspondence Game</h2>
        <p>A basic activity for teaching counting and cardinality is a game based on the principle of one-to-one correspondence. You can use objects like blocks, buttons, or fruit. Scatter a small number of these items on a table, and ask the child to count them. As they say each number, encourage them to touch or move each item. This helps them understand that each count corresponds to one item, reinforcing the concept of cardinality.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="game-div">
        <h2>"Guess the Number" Game</h2>
        <p>Hide a small number of items (1-5) in your hand and ask your child to guess how many are there. Reveal the items and count them together. This will help them understand the association between numbers and set sizes, and also provide an opportunity for them to practice counting and recognizing small quantities without counting.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="game-div">
        <h2>"Count and Match" Game</h2>
        <p>Create a set of cards with numbers and a set of cards with corresponding dots. For example, one card might have the number '3' on it and another card might have 3 dots. Mix up the cards and ask the child to match the number cards with the corresponding dot cards. They will count the dots to find the match. This game encourages counting and helps children understand the association between a number and the quantity it represents.</p>

    <h3><strong>Other helpful activities</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Set a specific number of items (e.g., three books to read at bedtime, 
            two cookies for dessert) and help your child work to get them by asking questions
             (e.g., “You have five books. How many do we need to put back?” 
             “You have one cookie. How many more can you have?”)</li>
        <li>Ask your child if he/she has a certain number of something. 
            Ask how he/she knows. Don’t always use the correct number. 
            (e.g., “Do you have three eyes?” “Do you have two feet?”)</li>
        <li>Count out food during snack time. Say how many there will be and then count until the total. </li>    
        <li>Estimate how many items are in a group and then count to check.</li>    
        <li>Play board games and count out the total number of moves. 
            For example, if moving four spaces, say “Four! 1-2-3-4! I moved four spaces.” </li>
