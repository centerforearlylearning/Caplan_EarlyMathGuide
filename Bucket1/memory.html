    <h1>Memory</h1>
    <p>Using a deck of cards, remove the face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) and pick out two of the suits of cards. This will leave you with 9 cards for each suit, and the goal will be to find the two cards where the number matches. Place the cards face down in front of you and your child. Each player is allowed to flip two cards at a time to check how many there are. If the cards do not match, place both cards face down once again. If they do match, the player gets to keep those cards. At the end of the game, the player with the most cards wins! To help your child understand the total on each card, be sure to count out the items on each card. This can also be helpful for children learning to recognize numerals.  </p>
