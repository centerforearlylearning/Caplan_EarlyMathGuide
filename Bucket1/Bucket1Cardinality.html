    <h1><strong><em>Developmental Milestone</em></strong></h1>
    <p>
        Children’s understanding of counting and cardinality (the total number of items in a set)
         initially develop separately. Early on, children’s understanding of counting develops much 
         like their understanding of the ABCs – they know the order the words go in but they do not 
         yet know the set size that each number word goes to. At this point in development children 
         are beginning to recognize small set sizes without needing to count. For example,
          seeing two crackers and knowing there are two without needing to count. 
          However, they may struggle to regularly use counting to answer questions about the total. 
          There are several ways to help children understand how to use counting to identify the total 
          number of items, including using counting books and games that require to identify how many 
          items there are.

    <h3><strong>Books</strong></h3>
    <p>Goal: Books can provide a great way to help children learn about set size. 
        At this stage, children may be able to identify how many there are on a page 
        by remembering what you have read or by looking at the numeral on the page. 
        To help them understand how counting can be used to identify the total, 
        be sure both count the items and label the total amount 
        (e.g., “Look 1-2-3-4-5. There are five bunnies!). 
        Research has suggested that it is crucial for children to hear both the count and 
        the overall total for them to make the connection that counting can be used to 
        identify how many there are. </p>
    <p>What to look for: Although there are many counting books available, 
        almost any picture book can become a great resource for early math learning! 
        The best books are books that you and your child enjoy reading together. </p>
    <p>What to avoid: Lift-the-flap books can provide interactivity and surprises for book reading, 
        but when learning to count, these books can be distracting and make it harder for children to learn. 
        Similarly, avoid books that draw attention away from counting or towards non-numerical features. </p>
    <p>What to do on each page: After reading each page count the items on the page 
        (or ask your child to do so) and then ask how many there were. </p>

    <h3>Card Games</h3>
    <p>Goal: Games provide a fun way to engage with numbers! 
        Games that require children to identify how many items there are can be a 
        great way to engage their counting skills. Look for games where children can 
        guess or estimate the total and then check the answer through counting. 
        Here, it is important to both identify the total and use counting, 
        so that children can develop an understanding of how counting is used to determine how many there are. </p>

    <h3><strong>Other helpful activities</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Set a specific number of items (e.g., three books to read at bedtime, 
            two cookies for dessert) and help your child work to get them by asking questions
             (e.g., “You have five books. How many do we need to put back?” 
             “You have one cookie. How many more can you have?”)</li>
        <li>Ask your child if he/she has a certain number of something. 
            Ask how he/she knows. Don’t always use the correct number. 
            (e.g., “Do you have three eyes?” “Do you have two feet?”)</li>
        <li>Count out food during snack time. Say how many there will be and then count until the total. </li>    
        <li>Estimate how many items are in a group and then count to check.</li>    
        <li>Play board games and count out the total number of moves. 
            For example, if moving four spaces, say “Four! 1-2-3-4! I moved four spaces.” </li>
