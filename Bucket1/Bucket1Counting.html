    <h1><strong><em>Developmental Milestone</em></strong></h1>
    <p>
        Children at this point in development are beginning to understand how the numbers in the count 
        follow a structured order, much like they learn the ABCs. 
        The goal at this stage is to help children learn to remember the order of the count list 
        by providing fun and easy to remember examples, such as counting songs. 
        Similarly, counting games can help children understand the structure of the counting routine 
        and how each number word applies to one item when counting. 
        There are many ways to promote children’s early counting skills. 
        Here we have examples of songs and games that can be used to help 
        promote children’s learning.

    <h3><strong>Games</strong></h3>
    <p> Goal: Games can provide a fun way to practice counting. 
        For board games, look for ones that allow children to move along the board in a relatively straight
         line (e.g., chutes and ladders). To help children develop an understanding of how to count from 
         1-to-10, have children count out the number of spots they move and have them watch while you do
          the same. For card games, look for cards that have a countable set (e.g., playing cards) 
          and ask children to count the smaller numbers to find out how many there are.

    <p><strong>Examples (click the games with links to find how to play!):</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chutes and ladders</li>
        <li>Candy land</li>
        <li>Hop scotch</li>
        <li>Memory Match (card game)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><strong>Songs</strong></h3>
    <p> Goal: Songs provide a fun introduction to the counting routine. 
        The tune from the music provides cues to help children remember the order of the counting sequence. 
        Find a song that you and your child would like to sing and see if you can learn the tune and repeat it later on!

            one at a time and count them aloud); hands and feet, fingers and toes while changing

        <li>Counting: while cleaning (e.g., picking up toys/trash), categories of things 
            (e.g., counting all green things), at traffic light, going up stairs, 
            backwards on the calendar, making up stories that include counting parts of animals, 
            down to get ready to transition to another activity</li>
