          <p>Games are essential for teaching children to count because they provide an interactive and enjoyable context, 
            making learning more engaging and less intimidating for young children. 
            Both board and card games can help reinforce and consolidate mathematical concepts and foster a positive attitude towards mathematics.

          <p class="lead"> Children at this point in development are beginning to understand how the numbers in the count 
            follow a structured order, much like they learn the ABCs. 
            The goal at this stage is to help children learn to remember the order of the count list 
            by providing fun and easy to remember examples, such as counting songs. 
            Similarly, counting games can help children understand the structure of the counting routine 
            and how each number word applies to one item when counting. 
            There are many ways to promote children’s early counting skills. 
            Above we have examples of songs and games that can be used to help 
            promote children’s learning. </p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Cardinality</h2>
          <p class="lead">Children’s understanding of counting and cardinality (the total number of items in a set)
            initially develop separately. Early on, children’s understanding of counting develops much 
            like their understanding of the ABCs – they know the order the words go in but they do not 
            yet know the set size that each number word goes to. At this point in development children 
            are beginning to recognize small set sizes without needing to count. For example,
             seeing two crackers and knowing there are two without needing to count. 
             However, they may struggle to regularly use counting to answer questions about the total. 
             There are several ways to help children understand how to use counting to identify the total 
             number of items, including using counting books and games that require children to identify how many 
             items there are.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Story Problems</h2>
          <p class="lead">Once children have developed an understanding of counting and set size (cardinality),
            they can begin to understand how to combine and decompose sets.
             Initially, children will be able to show an understanding of simple arithmetic using 
             manipulatives such as blocks. For example, understanding that adding one item and then 
             removing one item leaves the total number the same. Eventually, children link this 
             understanding to their understanding of mathematical symbols. 
             The symbolic understanding of mathematics that comes from knowing how to count and 
             recognizing numerals allows children to perform the more advanced arithmetic they 
             will learn at school.</p>

          <p class="lead">At this point in development, children may begin to recognize a few numerals that they regularly see.
            However, for unfamiliar numerals, particularly those beyond three or four, children have difficulty
            consistently identifying the number. In part, this is due to children regularly seeing numerals for smaller
            numbers or numbers that match their age (e.g., a three year old seeing 3 or being asked about 3). To help strengthen
            children's understanding of these mathematical symbols, regular exposure and use of numerals is necessary. Fortunately,
            there are many fun activities, such as board and card games that allow children to show off their number naming skills!</p>
