    <h1>Number War</h1>
    <p>Using a deck of cards, remove the face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) and divide the pile evenly between players. Each player then draws from the top of their pile. The player who has more on the card that they draw wins the hand and collects the cards. To check how many there are on each card be sure to count! If the two numbers match, each player then draws three more cards face down. Then, the fourth card that is drawn from each pile is used to break the tie – the player with the card with “more” wins the hand and all the cards. This continues until one player no longer has any cards remaining. The player with the most cards wins. By counting to compare how many are on each card, children are learning both how counting can be used to identify a total as well as how to compare relative values of different numbers. </p>
