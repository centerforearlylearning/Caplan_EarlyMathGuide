    <h1><strong><em>Developmental Milestone</em></strong></h1>
    <p>At this point in development, children may begin to recognize a few numerals that they regularly see.
        However, for unfamiliar numerals, particularly those beyond three or four, children have difficulty
        consistently identifying the number. In part, this is due to children regularly seeing numerals for smaller
        numbers or numbers that match their age (e.g., a three year old seeing 3 or being asked about 3). To help strengthen
        children's understanding of these mathematical symbols, regular exposure and use of numerals is necessary. Fortunately,
        there are many fun activities, such as board and card games that allow children to show off their number naming skills!
