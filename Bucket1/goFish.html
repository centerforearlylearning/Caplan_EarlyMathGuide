    <h1>Go Fish</h1>
    <p>Using a deck of cards, remove the face cards (Jack, Queen, and King). Each player draws five cards. The goal of the game is to match your number to one of your opponents. Players take turns asking another player if they have a specific number (e.g., “mom, do you have a four?”). If the player does have that card they give it the requester and the requester sets those cards aside. To check that the numbers match, count the items on each card to show the total numbers are the same! If the player does not have that card, they say “Nope. Go fish!” and the requester draws another card from the pile. The game continues until the pile is gone and the players have matched all cards. At the end, the player with the most pairs wins. This helps children make the connection between counting and the total number and also understand numerical equality.</p>
