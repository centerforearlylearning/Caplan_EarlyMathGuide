          <p class="lead"> Children at this point in development are able to consistent count up to 10 
            and are learning how to extend this count into the teens. 
            Additionally, children are developing a more flexible understanding of the count list, 
            showing that they can count on from numbers within their counting list. For example, starting at four and counting up from there.
            Now that children have a solid foundation in being able to count up to ten, it is important for them to learn to learn the transition into the teens
            as well as the pattern of each decade (e.g., 20s, 30s, etc.)  </p>

          <p class="lead">Children’s understanding of counting and cardinality (the total number of items in a set)
            are beginning to converge at this point in development. Early on, children’s understanding of counting develops much 
            like their understanding of the ABC's – they know the order the words go in but they do not 
            yet know the set size that each number word goes to. Now children have a solid foundation in their understanding of the count list and can begin to develop
            a more advanced understanding of how to use counting. For example,knowing that when they are asked "how many?" there are they can count to determine the exact number.
             However, they may still struggle when they are asked to count out sets from a larger pile (e.g., "can you give me six pretzels from the bag?") 
             There are several ways to help children gain comfort and understanding for how to count out sets including using games, counting books and integrating cardinality questions into everyday activities!</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Story Problems</h2>
          <p class="lead">Once children have developed an understanding of counting and set size (cardinality),
            they can begin to understand how to combine and decompose sets. At this point in development children can begin to follow along with simple stories and keep track of numerical transformations.
             Earlier on in development, children were only able to follow along when they could use physical objects (e.g., blocks) to show what happens when items are added to or taken away from a set.
             Now that children have an initial understanding of cardinality, they can begin to follow along and understand how the numbers in a story are related.   
             Children's understanding of counting, cardinality, number naming, and basic arithmetic provides a complete foundation for learning formal mathematics in school.</p>

          <p class="lead">At this point in development, children may begin to recognize a few numerals that they regularly see.
            However, for unfamiliar numerals, particularly those beyond three or four, children have difficulty
            consistently identifying the number. In part, this is due to children regularly seeing numerals for smaller
            numbers or numbers that match their age (e.g., a three year old seeing 3 or being asked about 3). To help strengthen
            children's understanding of these mathematical symbols, regular exposure and use of numerals is necessary. Fortunately,
            there are many fun activities, such as board and card games that allow children to show off their number naming skills!</p>
