          <p class="lead">Children at this point in development are able to consistently count up to 10 
            and are learning how to extend this count into the teens. 
            Additionally, children are developing a more flexible understanding of the count list, 
            showing that they can count on from numbers within their counting list. Below are different activities we have compiled with the help of early childcare experts. These activities
            and suggestions are meant to be a starting point or framework for you and your child to explore. Adapt or change the activities to find out what works 
            best for you and your child. The best activities are those that you and your child enjoy doing and want to do again!</p>
            <p class="lead">To help guide your understanding of your child's mathematical skills based off your answers on the previous page, we have also included
                an overview of your child's progress towards the bottom of this page.

          <p>Games are essential for teaching children to count because they provide an interactive and enjoyable context, 
            making learning more engaging and less intimidating for young children. 
            Both board and card games can help reinforce and consolidate mathematical concepts and foster a positive attitude towards mathematics.

          <p class="lead"> Children at this point in development are able to consistently count up to 10 
            and are learning how to extend this count into the teens. 
            Additionally, children are developing a more flexible understanding of the count list, 
            showing that they can count on from numbers within their counting list. For example, starting at four and counting up from there.
            Now that children have a solid foundation in being able to count up to ten, it is important for them to learn the transition into the teens
            as well as the pattern of each decade (e.g., 20s, 30s, etc.)  </p>

          <p class="lead">Children’s understanding of counting and cardinality (the total number of items in a set)
            are beginning to converge at this point in development. Early on, children’s understanding of counting develops much 
            like their understanding of the ABCs – they know the order the words go in but they do not 
            yet know the set size that each number word goes to. Now children have a solid foundation in their understanding of the count list and can begin to develop
            a more advanced understanding of how to use counting. For example, knowing that when they are asked "how many?" there are they can count to determine the exact number.
             However, they may still struggle when they are asked to count out sets from a larger pile (e.g., "can you give me six pretzels from the bag?") 
             There are several ways to help children gain comfort and understanding for how to count out sets including using games, counting books and integrating cardinality questions into everyday activities!</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Story Problems</h2>
          <p class="lead">Once children have developed an understanding of counting and set size (cardinality),
            they can begin to understand how to combine and decompose sets. At this point in development children can begin to follow along with simple stories and keep track of numerical transformations.
             Earlier on in development, children were only able to follow along when they could use physical objects (e.g., blocks) to show what happens when items are added to or taken away from a set.
             Now that children have an initial understanding of cardinality, they can begin to follow along and understand how the numbers in a story are related.   
             Children's understanding of counting, cardinality, number naming, and basic arithmetic provides a complete foundation for learning formal mathematics in school.</p>

          <p class="lead">At this point in development, children may have an understanding of many of the numerals between 1 and 10
              and they are beginning to show an understanding of how these numerals are used to specify the total. 
            However, children are still learning how the different numerals relate to each other. For example, they may need help putting the numerals in order
              or identifying what number comes next (i.e., if they're shown an 8 knowing 9 is the next number or 7 is the number before). The best way to help strengthen
            this understanding for your child is to give them frequent opportunities to focus on these numerical symbols. Through storybook reading or playing games, children 
            can learn how to identify and understand numerals.</p>
