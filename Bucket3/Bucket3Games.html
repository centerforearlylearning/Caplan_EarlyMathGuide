    <h1 style="text-align:center"><strong><em>Games for Beginning Counters</em></strong></h1>
    <p>
        Games provide a fun way to engage with numbers! 
        Games that require children to identify how many items there are can be a 
        great way to engage their counting skills, giving them the ability to connect their counting with the total number (cardinality). Card and board games with numerals 
        can add another layer of learning.
    </p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center">What to keep in mind when choosing and playing games:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Integrate Counting Into Gameplay:
            Make the most of the counting opportunities that the game naturally provides. 
            For example, when moving game pieces, count the spaces out loud with your child. 
            Also, count the game pieces, cards, or other elements before and after the game. 
            This consistent, casual reinforcement of counting will help your child develop this skill.</li>
        <li>Model Counting:
            Demonstrate how to count correctly during your turn. 
            Count your pieces, count out loud when you move your marker, and so on. 
            This modeling will give your child a clear example to imitate.
            </li>    
        <li>
            Keep it Fun:
            The primary goal should always be enjoyment. Make sure to keep the game fun and exciting for your child. 
            If they're enjoying the game, they're more likely to engage with the counting aspect. 
            Don't press too hard on the educational aspect; let learning happen naturally through play.

    <h1 style="text-align:center"> Examples of Easy Games to Play at Home:</h1>
    <div class="game-div">
        <h2>20 Steps to Treasure!</h2>
        <p>In this game, you can turn counting into an exciting treasure hunt! 
            Hide a small "treasure" (like a favorite toy or a healthy treat) somewhere in your house. 
            The aim of the game is for your child to find the treasure in exactly 20 steps. 
            Encourage them to count aloud each step they take. This helps reinforce the concept of counting up to 20.
            To focus on the teens, you could also set the treasure to be found in exactly 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 steps.
        </p>
        </div>
    <div class="game-div">
        <h2>Number Match</h2>
        <p>Create two sets of flashcards from 1 to 20. 
            On one set, write the numbers and on the other, draw dots or objects corresponding to each number. 
            Mix them up and spread them on a table or floor. 
            Your child's task is to match the number with the correct card that has the corresponding number of dots or objects. 
            This game not only helps your child with counting, but also in recognizing the written form of numbers. 
            Pay special attention to the cards from 13 to 19 to reinforce the teens.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="game-div">
        <h2>Counting Tower</h2>
        <p>This game needs some building blocks or Lego bricks - something that can be stacked. 
            Start by building a tower with your child. Each time you or your child adds a block, count aloud together. 
            Try and build towers with different numbers of blocks, focusing particularly on the teen numbers. 
            You could build a tower with 13 blocks, then 14, and so on up to 20. 
            This helps to reinforce these numbers in a fun and interactive way. 
            Plus, who doesn't love knocking the tower down and starting all over again? 
            This is a great opportunity to teach subtraction as well!
            </p>
    </div>

    <div class="game-div">
        <h2>Race to 20</h2>
        <p><strong>Materials:</strong>You'll need two six-sided dice (the standard dice most people have at home) and two tokens, pieces, or markers for each player.</p>
        <p><strong>How to Play:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Draw a number line from 1 to 20 on a piece of paper. Each player places their marker on the starting point (1).</li>
                <li>Players take turns rolling the two dice. They count the total number of dots on the dice and move their marker forward that many spaces on the number line.</li>
                <li>The first player to reach or exceed 20 is the winner!</li>
            </ul></p>

    <h3><strong>Other helpful activities</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Baking and Cooking Together: Practical activities like baking and cooking can be a great way to incorporate counting. 
            For instance, counting how many cups of flour are needed for a recipe, or how many berries go into each muffin. 
            This gives children a real-life context for counting and numbers.</li>
        <li>Grocery Shopping: When going grocery shopping, ask your child to help you count out items to put in the cart. 
            For example, you could ask them to pick out 15 apples, or 18 carrots. 
            This is a practical and engaging way to practice numbers.</li>
        <li>Count out food during snack time. Say how many there will be and then count until the total. </li>    
        <li>Estimate how many items are in a group and then count to check.</li>    
        <li>Play board games and count out the total number of moves. 
            For example, if moving four spaces, say “Four! 1-2-3-4! I moved four spaces.” </li>

    </ul>
