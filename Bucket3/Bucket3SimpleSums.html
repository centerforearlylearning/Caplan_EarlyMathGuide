    <p>At this point in development your child is ready to learn simple arithmetic problems. That is, problems where the total is less than ten. 
        Introducing children to mathematics through verbal story problems can help them gain familiarity with how to engage with mathematics in 
        everyday life and prepare them for school.

    <h3><strong>Grocery Store Math</strong></h3>
    <p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong>Play food items or items from around your house, play money or paper and a marker to make your own.</p>
    <p><strong>What to do:</strong>Set up a pretend grocery store with various items. Each item should have a price under 5. 
        Your child can then go shopping, adding up the prices of the items they want to buy. 
        You can also pose story problems, like "You have two coins and I have one coin. How many coins to we have in all? Is that enough to buy the apple that costs three coins?"</p>
    <hr>
    <h3><strong>Toy Party</strong></h3>
    <p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong>Some of your child's favorite toys or stuffed animals.</p>
    <p><strong>What to do:Have a party for your child's toys. Your child is in charge of "feeding" the toys. 
        They can use play food or draw pictures of food. 
        You can then pose problems like "If you have 5 toys at the party and each toy gets 2 pieces of food, how many pieces of food do you need in total?"
         or "You gave the teddy bear 3 biscuits, but he gave 1 biscuit to the dinosaur.
        How many biscuits does the teddy bear have now?"</strong></p>
