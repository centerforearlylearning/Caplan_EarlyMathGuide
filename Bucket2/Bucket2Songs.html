    <p>
        Songs provide a fun introduction to the counting routine. 
        The tune from the music provides cues to help children remember the order of the counting sequence. 
        Find a song that you and your child would like to sing and see if you can learn the tune and repeat it later on!

        <h3><strong>What to look for when choosing a song:</strong></h3>

        Here are a few things parents should look for when trying to find songs that will help their child learn to count:
<ul>
    <li> Clear Pronunciation: The song should have clear pronunciation of numbers so that your child can hear and learn the correct way to say each number.</li>
    <li>Repetition: Repetition aids memory, so look for songs that repeat numbers in sequence or that repeat the same number several times. This can help your child remember the numbers and the order in which they come.
    </li>
    <li>Rhythm and Melody: Catchy tunes can make the learning process more enjoyable and can also help in memorization. If the song has a good rhythm and melody, your child is more likely to engage with it and remember the content.
    </li>
    <li>Interactive Elements: Songs that encourage children to participate, like with hand movements or dancing, can increase engagement and make learning more fun.
    </li>
</ul>   
<strong>Remember, the goal is to make learning fun and engaging for your child! It's also important to sing and count along with your child to show them that you're interested in what they're learning, which will motivate them to participate more.</strong>
