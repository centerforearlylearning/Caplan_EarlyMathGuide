          <p class="lead">Children at this point in development have an understanding of the initial structure 
            of the count list, and are learning to extend this to higher numbers. 
            This understanding is relatively rigid, with children knowing how to count starting 
            from “one” but not yet understanding how counting can be applied in varied ways. Below are different activities we have compiled with the help of early childcare experts. These activities
            and suggestions are meant to be a starting point or framework for you and your child to explore. Adapt or change the activities to find out what works 
            best for you and your child. The best activities are those that you and your child enjoy doing and want to do again!</p>
            <p class="lead">To help guide your understanding of your child's mathematical skills based off your answers on the previous page, we have also included
                an overview of your child's progress towards the bottom of this page.

          <p>Providing children with a fun and low-stakes context for talking about numbers can be one of the most effective ways to boost their math skills!
            Both board and card games can help reinforce and consolidate mathematical concepts and foster a positive attitude towards mathematics.

          <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Cardinality</h2>
          <p class="lead">Children’s understanding of counting and cardinality (the total number of items in a set)
            initially develop separately. Early on, children’s understanding of counting develops much 
            like their understanding of the ABCs – they know the order the words go in but they do not 
            yet know the set size that each number word goes to. At this point in development children 
            are beginning to recognize small set sizes without needing to count and may be able to use counting to determine how many there are in sets fewer than five. 
             However, they may struggle to regularly use counting to answer questions about the total, particulary for larger set sizes. 
             There are several ways to help children understand how to use counting to identify the total 
             number of items, including using counting books and games that require children to identify how many 
             items there are.</p>

          <p class="lead">At this point in development children are still developing an understanding of how many items are in a set. 
             Initially, children will be able to show an understanding of simple arithmetic using 
             manipulatives such as blocks. For example, understanding that adding one item and then 
             removing one item leaves the total number the same. Eventually, children link this 
             understanding to their understanding of mathematical symbols. 
             The symbolic understanding of mathematics that comes from knowing how to count and 
             recognizing numerals allows children to perform the more advanced arithmetic they 
             will learn at school.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Number Naming</h2>
          <p class="lead">Children's understanding of numerals develops as they gain more and more familiarity with seeing and identifying numbers.
            At this point in development children have the most difficulty with unfamiliar numbers, particularly those beyond 5. 
            In part, this is due to children regularly seeing numerals for smaller
            numbers or numbers that match their age (e.g., a four year old seeing 4 or being asked about 4) as well as children's experience succesfully counting sets up to five. To help strengthen
            children's understanding of these mathematical symbols, regular exposure and use of numerals is necessary. Fortunately,
            there are many fun activities, such as board and card games that allow children to show off their number naming skills!</p>
