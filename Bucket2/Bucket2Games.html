    <h1 style="text-align:center"><strong><em>Games for Early Counters</em></strong></h1>
    <p>
        Games provide a fun way to engage with numbers! 
        Games that require children to identify how many items there are can be a 
        great way to engage their counting skills, giving them the ability to connect their counting with the total number (cardinality). Card and board games with numerals 
        can add another layer of learning.

    <h1 style="text-align:center">What to keep in mind when choosing and playing games:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Integrate Counting Into Gameplay:
            Make the most of the counting opportunities that the game naturally provides. 
            For example, when moving game pieces, count the spaces out loud with your child. 
            Also, count the game pieces, cards, or other elements before and after the game. 
            This consistent, casual reinforcement of counting will help your child develop this skill.</li>
        <li>Model Counting:
            Demonstrate how to count correctly during your turn. 
            Count your pieces, count out loud when you move your marker, and so on. 
            This modeling will give your child a clear example to imitate.
            </li>    
        <li>
            Keep it Fun:
            The primary goal should always be enjoyment. Make sure to keep the game fun and exciting for your child. 
            If they're enjoying the game, they're more likely to engage with the counting aspect. 
            Don't press too hard on the educational aspect; let learning happen naturally through play.
        </li>

    <h1 style="text-align:center"> Examples of Easy Games to Play at Home:</h1>
    <div class="game-div">
        <h2>Hi Ho! Cherry-O:</h2>
        <p>This classic counting board game is designed for young children. 
            The game involves spinning a spinner and adding the resulting number of cherries (between 1 and 4) to your basket. 
            The goal is to be the first to collect 10 cherries in your basket. 
            This game can be very helpful in teaching your child to count up to ten and also introduces them to basic concepts of addition and subtraction. 
            The colorful cherries also make the game visually appealing to young children.
        </p>
        </div>
    <div class="game-div">
        <h2>Sequence Counting!</h2>
        <p>In this game, shuffle a deck of cards (using only cards 1-10) and deal five cards to each player. 
            The remaining cards form a draw pile. Players take turns putting down cards in sequence (starting from 1), replacing their played card by drawing a new one from the pile. 
            If a player can't play, they draw a card. 
            The first player to run out of cards is the winner. This game helps with number recognition and understanding the numerical sequence.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="game-div">
        <h2>"How many?" Game</h2>
        <p>Hide a number of items (5-10) in your hand and ask your child to guess how many are there. To help keep your child intersted be sure to pick items they like (e.g., toys or goldfish).
             Reveal the items and count them together. 
             This will help them understand the association between numbers and set sizes, and also allow them to practice counting to numbers they are not used to counting.
            </p>
    </div>

    <div class="game-div">
        <h2>"Count and Match" Game</h2>
        <p>Create a set of cards with numbers and a set of cards with corresponding dots. For example, one card might have the number '3' on it and another card might have 3 dots. 
            Mix up the cards and ask the child to match the number cards with the corresponding dot cards. They will count the dots to find the match. 
            This game encourages counting and helps children understand the association between a number and the quantity it represents.</p>

    <h3><strong>Other helpful activities</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Set a specific number of items (e.g., three books to read at bedtime, 
            two cookies for dessert) and help your child work to get them by asking questions
             (e.g., “You have five books. How many do we need to put back?” 
             “You have one cookie. How many more can you have?”)</li>
        <li>Ask your child if he/she has a certain number of something. 
            Ask how he/she knows. Don’t always use the correct number. 
            (e.g., “Do you have three eyes?” “Do you have two feet?”)</li>
        <li>Count out food during snack time. Say how many there will be and then count until the total. </li>    
        <li>Estimate how many items are in a group and then count to check.</li>    
        <li>Play board games and count out the total number of moves. 
            For example, if moving four spaces, say “Four! 1-2-3-4! I moved four spaces.” </li>
