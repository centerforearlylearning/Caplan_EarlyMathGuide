    <h1 style="text-align:center"><strong><em>Storybooks for Beginning Counters</em></strong></h1>
    <p>Books can provide a great way to help children learn about set size. 
        At this stage, children may be able to identify how many there are on a page 
        by remembering what you have read or by looking at the numeral on the page. 
        To help them understand how counting can be used to identify the total, 
        be sure both count the items and label the total amount 
        (e.g., â€œLook 1-2-3-4-5. There are five bunnies!). 
        Research has suggested that it is crucial for children to hear both the count and 
        the overall total for them to make the connection that counting can be used to 
        identify how many there are. </p>

    <h3><strong>Choosing a Storybook</strong></h3>
    <p><strong>What to look for: </strong>Although there are many counting books available, 
        almost any picture book can become a great resource for early math learning! 
        The best books are books that you and your child enjoy reading together. </p>
    <p><strong>What to avoid:</strong>What to avoid: Lift-the-flap books can provide interactivity and surprises for book reading, 
        but when learning to count, these books can be distracting and make it harder for children to learn. 
        Similarly, avoid books that draw attention away from counting or towards non-numerical features. </p>
    <p><strong>What to do on each page:</strong> After reading each page count the items on the page 
        (or ask your child to do so) and then ask how many there were. </p>

    <h3>Storybook Examples</h3>
    <p>The best books to read with your child are those that the both of you enjoy and want to read again! Whichever book you choose, you can easily adapt it focus on counting, number naming, or identifying how many items there are on a page. </p>
